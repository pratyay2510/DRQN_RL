## **How to run training code:**
1. Install requirements from the requirements.txt file in the main branch.
2. Download the DQN.py, DRQN.py, run_dqn.ipynb and run_dqn.ipynb making sure they are all in the same directory.
3. Change the csv name to a desired csv file name in the jupyter notebooks where the hyperparameters are defined.
4. Run all the cells in the notebooks. The agent should start learning!

## **How to plot:**
1. Train the models to get the csv files. 
2. Define the paths of the csv files in the plot.ipynb notebook and run the code. It should generate a plot with required legends.
